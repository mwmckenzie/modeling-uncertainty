![Example 1000 member ensemble model for infectious persons per 10,000](/assets/images/ensemble_model_front_page.png)*A beautiful, and somewhat mesmerizing, example of a "Spaghetti Plot" displaying the results from a 1,000 model ensemble. The results depict the outcome of randomly sampled initial conditions run through the SEIR model created for this site's first project. See the sidebar for links to the details and code.*

### COVID-19 Probabilistic Ensemble Model
- Multiple annotated Python Jupyter notebooks for the first COVID-19 Probabilistic Ensemble Model created and posted:
  - A probility distribution discovery and creation application.
  - The main ensemble model and data organization and export application.
  - A data visualization and exploration application.
- Testing Docker to host interactive Jupyter notebooks and apps for exploring some of  the model results online:
